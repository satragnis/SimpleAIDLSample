# SimpleAIDLSample
This is a simple Aidl implementation in kotlin. 

The service returns the multiplication product of 2 number fromt the mainActivity just like any other application.
The only difference is that the service acts as a server and the client is your MainActivity. 
This is achieved via an Interface ie the AIDL. AIDL is also used for making RCP calls to the android system
